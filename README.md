## Recent Activity (Dec 2025)
- 190+ commits to **TheMarketDecoder** (Nov–Dec): Proprietary real-time financial sentiment & report generation tool  
- Ongoing development on **BTC Alpha Engine**: Systematic crypto strategy backtester with refined metrics and API-ready outputs

## Highlighted Private Projects
- **TheMarketDecoder** (Private – Heavy active development)
   
  Modular NLP pipeline using FinBERT/transformers for sentiment extraction from SEC filings, news, and social data. Features batch S&P 500 processing, structured JSON/Markdown parsing, branded PDF reports, and chart generation. Demonstrated alpha in personal trading.
  
- **BTC Alpha Engine** (Private)
  
  Institutional-grade crypto quant engine: Backtesting framework, free metric sourcing (NVT, flows, sentiment), volatility-scaled sizing, and tiered strategy outputs. 5-year simulations show strong risk-adjusted returns.

- **Solana Metadata Scraper** (Private | Cypher-Fi)
  
  Metadata_Pull is a Python script that uses the Solscan API to fetch all tokens from a specified Solana wallet, extracts detailed metadata (including frog number and image URL) specifically for FROG NFTs, and exports the results to a CSV file using requests, pandas, and streaming for efficient memory usage.

- **InFROGmation-Kiosk** (Private | Cypher-Fi)
  
  A Discord bot that responds to user command by sending an interactive embedded guide with buttons, allowing users to privately open and navigate through multiple pages of information via ephemeral responses and message edits to keep the channel clean.

- **Kira_Supply.py** (Private | Cypher-Fi)
  
  Discord bot that periodically checks the token balances of two specified Solana wallets for the KIRA token (associated with frog and millionSol emissions), sends dynamic update messages to a Discord channel if changes are detected, and is automated via a Windows batch file and Task Scheduler for scheduled runs with logging instead of long sleeps.

(Happy to share access, demos, or code samples during interviews!)
